GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

1. The application is served by the server and the template engine handlebars is used
2. front end files are stored in /views
3. static files are stored in /public
4. the index page is called index.handlebars 
5. the webcast page is called webcast.handlebars
6. I decided to use handlebars because its the easiest template engine that allowed seamless communication between the server and the front-end. I thought using  a framework like React would've been too much for this project


NOTE :

There were no sessions pre-scheduled for this project so i create 3 session for collaborate with id's 1134,1135,1136. I hard coded id 1134 for this project but in a real life scenario, the user would have received an email invite with the event id for when they log in and they would input that into the log in screen. Also,  the log in screen adds the user as participant. You have log in as a moderator provided in the project description in order for the webcast to start for registered user. Lastly, I decided to go with the tab view so you can toggle back in forth between both webcast so each could take up the whole screen. 

For talcast, no matter what first and last name you input, you will be welcomed as Mango. I didnt know how to change that.
